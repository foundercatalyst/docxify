# DocXify

If you've ever wanted to generate a Word Document containing a letter or a contract (not a full page layout advert or advanced formatting like that), DocXify is the gem you need in your life.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    bundle add docxify

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    gem install docxify

## Usage

```ruby
@docx = DocXify::Document.new()
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
